# deep_learning_assignment
A two-person team assignment. 
- The first notebook DL1 applies a number of Neural Network models(RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs) with exploration in different pretrained embeddings in order to predict the news article section of a body of test
- The second notebook DL2 explores transfer learning of the models build in DL1 and applies them to a new data set 
- The third notebook DL3 applies an LSTM model to generate text based on a prompt imputted by the end user.
